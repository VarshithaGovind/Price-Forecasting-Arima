# Price-Forecasting-Arima
A Streamlit-based tool using ARIMA for forecasting prices of Agri-horticultural commodities. It helps predict market trends, supports policy planning, and enables real-time visualization for improving food security and aiding farmers’ and traders’ decisions.
This project predicts prices of crucial agri-horticultural crops such as pulses and onions based on the ARIMA model, providing a credible solution to address agricultural price volatility. Developed with Python, it leverages the Statsmodels library for time-series analysis and Streamlit for interactive visualization and hosting. For enriching user experience, a chatbot is incorporated through Cohere and LangChain such that users can communicate with the system, pose queries, and receive real-time explanations on trends, predictions, and insights from data. The objective is to provide farmers, traders, and policymakers with precise price prediction, facilitating timely interventions in the market, enhanced buffer stock planning, and enhanced food security. The project integrates data preprocessing, ARIMA-based forecasting, and real-time graphical insights to form an end-to-end decision-support tool.
